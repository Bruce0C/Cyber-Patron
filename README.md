The site aims to deliver a smooth, visually engaging shopping experience that builds trust through secure payments, user accounts, and clear order feedback.
Ultimately the goal of the platform is to provide art to digital art enthusiasts in a convenient and reliable way for buyers.

**Agile Planning**

This project was developed using agile methodologies, focusing on delivering functional features in short sprints. The development cycle was divided into three sprints over a seven-day period, with each sprint building upon the previous one to ensure continuous progress.
All features were grouped into epics and prioritized using the MoSCoW method — Must have, Should have, and Could have. “Must have” stories, such as user authentication, product listings, and payment integration, were developed first to ensure that the core e-commerce functionality was in place early. Once the essential features were complete, focus shifted to “Should have” enhancements like user feedback messages and responsive design, followed by “Could have” improvements such as marketing and SEO optimizations.
A GitHub Projects Kanban board was used to manage workflow and track progress throughout development. Each user story was assigned a story point value to reflect its complexity and the effort required for completetion. This approach allowed for clear visibility of progress, flexibility in iteration, and ensured that all critical goals were delivered within the project timeframe.
